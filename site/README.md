# Crane website

This is the website for Crane!

We use [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and [google/docsy](https://github.com/google/docsy) to be the website template for development.

## Install DevDependencies

```bash
npm i
```

## Running the website locally

Building and running the site locally requires a recent `extended` version of [Hugo](https://gohugo.io).
You can find out more about how to install Hugo for your environment in our
[Getting started](https://www.docsy.dev/docs/getting-started/#prerequisites-and-installation) guide.

```
hugo server
```

## Build the static website

```bash
hugo --minify
```
